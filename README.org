#+title: Geo-Algebra

This module is a work in progress.

Currently, the default metric is for 3-dimensional Conformal Geometric
Algebra. However, it's easy to change, just set =global-algebra= to
another algebra. You can see how to create algebras and metrics in
=algebras.rkt= and =metrics.rkt= respectively.
